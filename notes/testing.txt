React Testing Library vs Jest

React Testing Library - React Testing Library provides a virtual dom for tests
Jest - Jest is a test runner that finds test, run tests and determines whether tests pass or fail 

Jest Assertions - 
1)expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
expect - jest global,start the assertion
matcher - type of assertion this matcher comes from jest-dom
2)expect(elemet.textContent).toBe('Hello');
3)expect(elementsArray).toHaveLength(5);

Jest-DOM -
src/setupTests.js imports it before each test, makes watchers available
DOM based matchers eg - toBeVisible() or toBeChecked

Jest - 
React Testing Library helps with rendering components into virtualDOM, searching virtualDOM, interacting with virtualDOM
It needs a test runner - find tests, run them, make assertions

npm test - runs a script that runs jest in watch mode
watch mode - watch for changes in file since last commit

TDD(Test Driven Development)
Types of tests - 
1) Unit tests - tests one unit of code in isolation
2) Integration tests - how multiple units work together
3) Functional tests - tests a particular function of software
4) Acceptance/End-to-end tests

Accessibility and Finding elements - getByRole('link', {name : 'React App'})
https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#role_definitions
https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom

import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";

screen - global object screen have access to virtualDOM created by render
fireEvent - that helps us to interact with the virtualDOM

Unit testing functions - 
function seperate from components
used by several components or have complex logic

describe statements is a way to grouping test

ESLint - popular linter for javascript - linter is basically a tool that analyzes syntax and marks syntax that breaks rule
keeps code styling consistent
Prettier - It is formatter

testing library and jest dom eslint plugin

plugins and rules to be used for eslint linter

it's recommended to use userevent than fireevent
